# 🌡️ R-Week1-City-Temperature-Analysis
Week1 R programming assignment, analyzing 10 weeks of average temperature data for two cities using vectors, plots, and basic R operations. This repository contains my Week 1 assignment for the **Data Science Internship** at **Neozeno Talent**, under the mentorship of Aishwarya.

## 📌 Project Title
**City Temperature Trends: Analyzing Weekly Climate Patterns Using R**

## 📖 Description
Using R programming, I analyzed **10 weeks of average temperature data** for my city, and compared it with another city. This project helped reinforce fundamental concepts like:

- Creating and manipulating vectors.
- Assigning labels using `names()`.
- Applying basic statistics: `min()`, `max()`, `mean()`.
- Filtering data with logical conditions.
- Simulating a heatwave.
- Visualizing data using `plot()`.

## 🧪 Tools Used
- R
- RStudio
- R Markdown (`.Rmd`)
- Visual Crossing Weather API (for sample data)

## 📈 Outputs
- Bar and line plots for city temperature trends.
- Console outputs with temperature analysis.
- Heatwave simulation results.

## 📂 Files Included
- `Week1_City_Temp_Analysis.Rmd`.
–  Main R Markdown file with code and comments.
